This year I'm participating in the Google Summer of Code with the [ML4SCI](https://ml4sci.org) organization.
My [project proposal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ePnjKlJs) deals with a quantum variational autoencoder (QVAE) for the anaysis of particle physics data.
Such unsupervised learning paradigms can be used to search for new physics in a model-agnostic way {{< cite "Kasieczka2021" >}}.
These models are thereby trained on Standard Model data and search for anomalous events that deviate from the known physics. 
With the rise of NISQ-devices {{< cite "Preskill2018" >}} the question comes up if quantum machine learning can enhance classical machine learning applications to hep problems.

Since we are encouraged by Google to publicly share our work, I set up this blog to document the project and share some of my scientific interests.
