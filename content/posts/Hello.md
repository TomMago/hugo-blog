This year I'm participating in the Google Summer of Code with the [ML4SCI](https://ml4sci.org) organization.
My [project proposal](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ePnjKlJs) deals with a quantum variational autoencoder (QVAE) for the anaysis of particle physics data.
This blog is supposed to document the experience and share some of my scientific interests.
