[{"content":"In my GSoC project I explore the use of Quantum Autoencoders for the analysis of LHC data. Autoencoders are an unsupervised learning technique, which learns a smaller latent representations of data. In this post I want to show possible ideas for an Autoencoder circuit on a Quantum Device.\nA naive Quantum Autoencoder My first idea for a Quantum circuit closely follows the architecture of a classical autoencoder. The structure of the circuit is conceptually sketched in the following figure. Here the Autoencoder has an input dimension of three and compresses the data to a single qbit.\nInsert figure Each line represents a single qbit and reading from left to right, consecutive transformations are applied to them. The classical training data is first encoded into a quantum state indicated by $|\\Psi\\big\u0026gt;$. This can be done with different encodings e.g. the angle encoding. After feeding the data into the first three qbits, an encoding block is applied. The encoder is a parameterized unitary transformation $U(\\Theta)$. It consists of rotations on the block sphere and entaglement usign CNOT gates. The parameters $\\Theta$ are angles for the rotations which will eventually be learned when training the autoencoder. After applying the encoder, a second parametrized circuit follows, which acts as the decoder. The decoder only overlaps with the encoder at a subset of its qbits, in this example a single one. This qbit acts as the smaller latent space of the autoencoder. The rest of the decoder circuit acts on qbits which where initialized as $|0\\big\u0026gt;$. The goal of an Autoencoder is to learn to reconstruct the input data after compressing it to the latent space. To test this, we can use a SWAP test with three reference bits. The reference bits were initilized to the input state of the data. The SWAP test can then measure the similarity of the input datas state $|\\Psi\\big\u0026gt;$ with the output of the decoder $|\\phi\\big\u0026gt;$. This similarity $\\big|\\big\u0026lt;\\Psi|\\phi\\big\u0026gt;\\big|^2$, called fidelity, can be measured at the readout bit.\nSince we want to learn parameters that enable the autoencoder to reconstruct the input, we can use $L = 1-\\big|\\big\u0026lt;\\Psi|\\phi\\big\u0026gt;\\big|^2$ as loss function to train the parameters of the circuit.\nComment on training optimizers and training on quantum computer (parameter shift rule) An example for a circuit of a $3\\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 3$ autoencoder is shown below.\nQAE circuit image In this example for simplissity the Encoder and Decoder consist of only a single layer using $R_y(\\Theta_i)$ gates and entaglement by CNOT. The SWAP test is carried out using controlled SWAP gates on the output of the decoder and the reference bits. The controlling bit is the last qbit which is used to readout the result of the SWAP test. It is initialized as $|0\\big\u0026gt;$ and prepared with a Hadamard gate, leads to the state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\big\u0026gt; + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1\\big\u0026gt;$. The controlled SWAP operation on two states $|\\psi\u0026gt;$ and $|\\phi\u0026gt;$ transfers the three qbit system into the state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0,\\psi,\\phi\\big\u0026gt; + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|1,\\phi,\\psi\\big\u0026gt;$. The $|\\psi\u0026gt;$ could thereby be the state of an output qbit of the decoder and $|\\phi\u0026gt;$ the state of a respective reference bit. Applying another Hadamard gate to the SWAP qbit transfers the state to $$\nA simpler Quantum Autoencoder ( Citation: Preskill,\u0026#32;2018 Preskill,\u0026#32; J. \u0026#32; (2018). \u0026#32;Quantum Computing in the NISQ era and beyond.
